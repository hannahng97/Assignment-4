```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#### Question 5
What does \texttt{tibble::enframe()} do? When might you use it?

```{r}
?tibble::enframe
```

It converts vectors to a data frame with its names and values, so you would use it when you need to convert vectors to two column data frames.
